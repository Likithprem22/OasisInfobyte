          <br>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim 
            family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency 
            and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and 
            imam of a local mosque;his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took 
            Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was 
            the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.

          <br>
          <p>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical 
            Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & 
            Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained 
            unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, 
            the renowned space scientist.He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first 
            Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the 
            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite 
            Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; 
            Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam 
            received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

          <br>
          <h3>Presidency:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election 
            with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 
            25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, 
            expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist 
            Congress Party backed his candidacy.After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to 
            seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:I am really 
            overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message 
            I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.
